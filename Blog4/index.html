               <p>One of the finest forts built in Satara District, Maharashtra, India, is Mahimangad Fort. This forts fortification is still strong and looks good. This fort is about 3200 feet above sea level. The trail of the fort isn’t that difficult. The tail is easy, and it hardly takes about an hour to reach the fort. The fort huge and a beautiful place to explore. Mahimangad Village is the base village of this fort. 

Starting point: Mahimangad village, Satara District, Maharashtra. 
Water resources: No proper drinking water facility available on the fort. It is preferred to carry own drinking water. 2 liters minimum per person. 
Trek Gradient: The trail till the top of the fort is straightforward. One of the easiest and finest forts of Satara District. 
Best months to visit the fort: Winter season is the best time to visit this place. From December to February is the peak time to visit the fort. </p>
         <p>Mahimangad Fort was built by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and was one of the forts with Varugad, Vardhangad, and many more in the Satara region. Turjabhavani temple is the starting point of the trek. From here, we can see the fortification of the fort. Walking ahead, one will also see a Bhavani Mata Mandir, which is also well maintained. Both the temples are in good condition. The villagers recently built Bhavani temple’s roof. Behind this temple, there is a huge water tank. This water tank has steps made for dipping in and take out water. After climbing for about half an hour, the rock-cut steps will take you till the fort's entrance. The fortification of the fort is healthy after so many years. One will reach the first door within five minutes. Moving on from there, one will see the second door, which is named “Hastmukh Darwaja”. 

This door has small carvings of an elephant on both sides of the door at the bottom. The second door is now disputed; the door is assumed to be huge and built with strategical importance as its remnants are seen around the door after entering it. One can visit Lord Hanuman temple, which is beautifully placed on the fort, moving ahead on the top. This temple will be seen easily as soon as one walks on to the fort crossing the second door. A small water tank is also placed on the fort. This water tank has water all the 12 months of the year. Many Secret doors are also seen on the fort, also locally known as “Chor Darwaja.” The fortress and its fortification are huge to explore and visit. It will take around one hour to explore the fort. </p>
